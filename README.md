   - Click "Save"

### Getting Test ETH for Amoy Testnet

1. **Get Free Test ETH**:
   - Visit [Amoy Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/amoy)
   - Connect your wallet and request test ETH
   - Wait a few moments for the ETH to appear in your wallet

   Alternative faucet options:
   - [Ethereum Amoy Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/amoy)
   - [PolygonZK Amoy Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/amoy)

2. **Verify Your Balance**:
   - In MetaMask, ensure you've selected "Amoy Testnet" as your network
   - Check that your ETH balance has updated with the test tokens

### Connecting MetaMask to the e-Voting Application

1. **Access the Application**:
   - Open the e-Voting application in your browser
   - Click "Connect Wallet" on the homepage

2. **Authorize Connection**:
   - MetaMask will prompt you to connect
   - Select the account you want to use
   - Make sure "Amoy Testnet" is selected as your network
   - Confirm the connection

3. **Verify Connection**:
   - Once connected, your wallet address should appear in the application
   - The application will display "Connected to Amoy Testnet"

Now you're ready to use the e-Voting application with MetaMask and Amoy Testnet!

## üß† Advanced Features

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification

The system uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify voter eligibility without revealing sensitive information:

1. User provides credentials (College ID, passphrase)
2. System generates a proof that the user is on the approved voter list
3. Smart contract verifies the proof without revealing the user's identity
4. Vote is recorded if the proof is valid

### Error Handling

Sophisticated error handling for various scenarios:

- **Double Voting**: Clear alerts when a user attempts to vote twice
- **Non-Participant**: Informative messages when unregistered users attempt to vote
- **Transaction Failures**: User-friendly error messages with recovery options
- **Network Issues**: Resilient connections with retry mechanisms

## üå± Future Enhancements

- **Mobile Application**: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android
- **DAO Integration**: Governance features for community-run elections
